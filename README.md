Smart Farming: Crop Disease & Water Prediction Web App 
📌 Overview

This project is a web-based machine learning application that helps in crop disease detection and water requirement prediction.
It combines a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with a Flask backend (Python) and a trained deep learning model (model.h5).

Users can:

Upload an image of a crop leaf → get disease classification.

Provide crop/land details → get water requirement predictions.

🚀 Features

🖼 Image-based Crop Disease Detection (via trained ML model).

💧 Water Requirement Estimation for crops.

🌾 Crop Information Retrieval (list of supported crops).

🌐 Web-based Interface (simple, interactive, user-friendly).

✅ REST API Integration for smooth frontend–backend communication.

🔍 Code Quality Analysis with SonarQube.
